# THIS YEAR’S RUN
Hello HAT Run runners, volunteers, and fans,

The race is ON!  2022 marks the 32nd annual running of this great ultra-marathon on the trails of Susquehanna State Park, located in Havre de Grace, MD.  The 50-kilometer course is mostly single-track trail with a mix of open fields, dirt road, and minimal paved road. Our course features a starting loop of 3.6 miles followed by two identical loops of 13.7 miles with nearly 4,300 feet of climbing throughout. Be ready for 4 stream crossings – these can be challenging depending on the water level (read: there is always the chance of getting wet feet!)

This Stepping Stone Museum is our race day headquarters as well as the start/finish line.  HQ is filled with spectators, volunteers, and of course, our esteemed RD’s waiting to encourage you at mile 17.3 and shake your hand at that glorious 31-mile finish-line.  Along the way, you’ll experience our world-renowned aid stations filled with everything you need to keep you hydrated, energized and inspired. If you aren’t running, volunteers and spectators are always welcome!

One last thing… the gear! We take pride in our high-quality runner swag.  Expect a gift from us both before AND after the race.  It’ll be a surprise, but we promise it’s worth the wait.  And, your HAT run will be topped off with the official HAT hat. Wear it with pride to celebrate your accomplishment!

Check out our Runners section for all the fine print (fees, policies, course map, etc).

We’ll be ready for you on March 19. Don’t miss this great ultra-run experience!
