The course features nearly 4,300 feet of climbing. There is a starting loop of 3.6 miles followed by two identical loops of 13.7 miles. There are 4 stream crossings that can be challenging depending on the water level – there is always the chance of getting wet feet.</p><p><img src=../img/hat_course_map.png alt="Hat Run Course Map"></p><p><a href=https://www.plotaroute.com/route/774080>HAT 50K on www.plotaroute.com</a></p><p><a href=http://localhost:1313/img/hat_course_map.png>Download a PDF of the HAT Course</a></p><h2 id=entry-and-refund-policy>Entry and Refund Policy</h2><p>The starting field is limited to 500 runners. A waiting list will be maintained for entrants 501-750. Entrants will be added on a first come first served basis as the original entrant pool is reduced by withdrawals.</p><h2 id=deferrals-and-transfers>Deferrals and Transfers</h2><p>We do not defer or transfer entries.</p><h2 id=withdrawal>Withdrawal</h2><p>Withdrawing from the race can be done through UltraSignup.</p><ol><li>Sign in to <a href=http://ultrasignup.com>UltraSignup</a></li><li>Go to Account Info and select My Registrations,</li><li>Edit Hat Run and Click Cancel.</li></ol><h2 id=refunds>Refunds</h2><p>2021: We hope to eliminate the need for refunds in 2021. Currently working with Ultra Signup to only collect entry fee once we know the race is a go. More information to follow.</p><p>Normal Year: Entry refund until 2 JAN 2020 is $50. Entry refund until 1 MAR 2020 is $40 unless the waitlist is cleared, then no refunds at that point.</p><h2 id=hat-run-policy-on-event-cancellation>HAT Run Policy on Event Cancellation</h2><p>Forces beyond our control can lead to the cancellation of the event. If the HAT Run is canceled, it is possible that you will receive no refund of your entry fee. We will, however, endeavor to issue refunds or make other compensation to the extent funds are available to do so. The occurrences that can cause a race cancellation are not predictable. Cancellations will occur when there is a serious threat to the safety of runners and volunteers such as forest fires, hurricanes, and tornadoes, or in the event of a national emergency. These generally occur with little advance notice. As run organizers, we are at the mercy of these events. The HAT Run is a volunteer-supported, non-profit event. The HAT Run is expensive because we provide quality support, apparel, and awards. The costs for this is supported by entry fees – not sponsorship. We cannot absorb all of these costs and take the risk of cancellation by ourselves. Consequently, the effect of our policy is that the entrants to the HAT Run must share in the risk that it will be canceled. Please understand this when you enter.</p><p>Here is the policy we expect to follow when the run is subject to cancellation. Each situation is different so these are only guidelines.</p><h2 id=keeping-you-informed>Keeping You Informed</h2><p>We will try to keep entrants informed when there is a potential for cancellation. We will use the web site primarily and use the HAT Run Facebook page and Twitter to supplement.</p><h2 id=reimbursement>Reimbursement</h2><p>In the event that a race is canceled, we cannot promise any refund. We will first pay all outstanding bills associated with the event that we cannot cancel or legally avoid. If there is money left over after paying the expenses we have incurred, we will try to make a reimbursement to runners from the remaining entry fees available to us. The closer the cancellation is to the race date, the less likely there will be any reimbursement and if a race is stopped while in progress, there will be no reimbursement. If the amount of the refund is small, we may not bother with it, or we may only give credit toward future entry fees.</p><h2 id=rescheduling>Rescheduling</h2><p>Rescheduling the event is unlikely given the complexity of coordinating with the various County, State Park Service, the Steppingstone Museum and the State of Maryland.</p><h2 id=friday-packet-pickup>Friday Packet Pickup</h2><p>Packet pickup is held from 3:00 pm to 6:00 pm in the garage near the back of the parking lot. If you are new to the event this is a good time to familiarize yourself with the start and finish areas as well asking any questions you may have about the event or shopping for technical running gear.</p><h2 id=race-day-schedule>Race Day Schedule</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Time of day</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>6:45</td><td>Steppingstone gates open for parking</td></tr><tr><td>7:00 – 8:45</td><td>Race registration and packet pickup (Near Parking Lot)</td></tr><tr><td>8:45</td><td>Move to the pavilion and begin to assemble in the starting field</td></tr><tr><td>9:00</td><td>Start of the HAT Run.
