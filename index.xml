If you are caught transferring or selling your bib, using a pacer or running as a bandit, you will be barred from future events.
Time Constraints will be STRICTLY enforced.

The course features nearly 4,300 feet of climbing. There is a starting loop of 3.6 miles followed by two identical loops of 13.7 miles. There are 4 stream crossings that can be challenging depending on the water level – there is always the chance of getting wet feet.
